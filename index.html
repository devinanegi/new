         <p>As winter went on, every morning’s spoon of buckwheat honey
resembled more the taste of that isosceles at midpoint
of your weight, its smell brought sweetly back the pendulum-like pace
moving us from windowsill to floor, from floor to bed, and back
to floor, mapping haste’s measure of the room, our smell, but also
meubles, book dust, hanging smoke, an open bottle, everything
connecting now for me, as smells will do, things that don’t connect,
may not be mine in memory, like childhood’s corridors, cats,
other’s bodies, and maybe other minds. All this from the spoon:
sweet, grassy in my nose, cloying almost, bitter on the tongue.

         <p>It felt so normal to be ‘inspected,’ ‘looked at,’
‘examined,’ ‘explored,’ ‘interrogated’—
why does the perceptually deprived brain play such tricks?
Still firing off, cleaning up the sopping wetness
of the clouds with a snuffed-out candle wick. The spider
can’t be frightened into a jar. Imagine remembering anything
about those years other than pure sensation—
could the tree do it? The stump of one fallen
nourished for centuries by its surroundings. After some
time I learned to pay attention to ah and oh
and hey—body demanding a toll when another

         <p>My father's oak, three years taller, stands taller now than I. 
Two crows for company. 

One gripping the telephone wire overhead, cries out.
The other, lumbering across the cold dirt like a man in a bar room, answers.

Blocks away, a cloud of starlings startles and lifts in one great wavering
gesture, from one anonymous tree to another,

leaves in a deliberate wind,

and I, standing here, feel for one moment, that the earth does not move.

The lumbering crow stumbles and flies screeching to the wire near the other. 

The leaves of the oak flutter, tarnished and dumb.

Speak to me, crows. Teach me to walk like a sailor.
Tell me what this tree superintends.
